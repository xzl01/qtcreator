    \title Set high DPI scaling

    The operating systems that \QC supports implement high dots-per-inch (DPI)
    scaling at varying levels. Therefore, \QC handles high DPI scaling
    differently on different operating systems:

    \list
        \li On \macos, \QC forces high DPI scaling, which means that it allows
            Qt to use the system scaling factor as the \QC scaling factor.
        \li On Windows, if you do not set \l{High DPI}
            {scaling environment variables}, \QC instructs Qt to detect the
            scaling factor and use it as the \QC scaling factor.
        \li On Linux, \QC leaves it to the user to enable high DPI scaling
            because the process varies so much on different distributions
            and windowing systems that it cannot be reliably done automatically.
    \endlist

    To override the default approach and always enable high DPI scaling:

        \list 1
            \li Select \uicontrol Edit > \uicontrol Preferences >
                \uicontrol Environment > \uicontrol Interface.
                \image qtcreator-preferences-environment-interface.webp {Interface tab in Environment preferences}
            \li Select \uicontrol {Enable high DPI scaling}.
            \li Restart \QC to have the change take effect.
    \endlist
*/
