      already
  * Stop shipping the upstream changelogs in /usr/share/doc/qtcreator-data/,

    can be opened from the Help menu.

  * Remove breaks/replaces for versions older than oldstable.
  * Temporarily add the clang-tidy, and clang-tools build dependencies to
    workaround the broken CMake config files shipped in llvm-14-dev (which is
    the current version pulled by llvm-dev): it is still affected by #1021857,

  * Team upload.
  * New upstream development release.
  * Update the build dependencies according to the upstream build system:
    - drop libicu-dev, no more used for many releases already
    - drop liblitehtml-dev, as the system version is not enough to replace the
      embedded copy
    - drop zlib1g-dev, not directly used
    - explicitly add python3, used during the build
  * Use a qtcreator-data.docs file to install the upstream changelog files,
    rather than passing all of them as arguments to dh_installdocs.
  * Limit the search of 'qmldir' files only to those executable, and make the
    chmod call verbose so it is easier to see whether there are any.

    - upstream_Correctly-include-KSyntaxHighlighting-headers.patch: drop,
      backported from upstream
    - debian_paths.diff: refresh
  * Switch qtcreator to build with Qt6 instead of Qt5:
    - remove libkf5syntaxhighlighting-dev, libqt5opengl5-dev,
      libqt5serialport5-dev, libqt5sql5-sqlite, libqt5svg5-dev,
      libqt5x11extras5-dev, qml-module-qtquick-controls, qml-module-qtquick2,
      qtbase5-dev, qtbase5-private-dev, qtdeclarative5-dev,
      qtdeclarative5-private-dev, qtscript5-dev, qttools5-dev,
      qttools5-dev-tools, and qttools5-private-dev
    - add libqt6core5compat6-dev, libqt6opengl6-dev, libqt6quicktimeline6-dev,
      libqt6serialport6-dev, libqt6shadertools6-dev, libqt6svg6-dev,
      qt6-base-dev, qt6-base-private-dev, qt6-declarative-dev,
      qt6-declarative-private-dev, qt6-quick3d-dev, qt6-tools-dev, and
      qt6-tools-private-dev
    - stop exporting QT_SELECT, no more needed
    - replace libqt5designercomponents5 with libqt6designercomponents6 in the
      strict dependency for Designer bits
    - update the runtime dependencies/recommends/suggests:
      - switch libqt5sql5-sqlite to libqt6sql6-sqlite
      - switch qml-module-qtqml-models2 to qml6-module-qtqml-models
      - switch qml-module-qtquick-controls to qml6-module-qtquick-controls
      - switch qml-module-qtquick2 to qml6-module-qtquick
      - drop qtchooser, no more needed with Qt6
      - switch qmlscene to qmlscene-qt6
      - drop qt5-doc, there is no Qt6 equivalent in Debian yet
      - switch qtbase5-dev-tools to qt6-base-dev-tools
      - switch qtdeclarative5-dev-tools to qt6-declarative-dev-tools
      - switch qttools5-dev-tools to qt6-tools-dev-tools
      - switch qttranslations5-l10n to qt6-translations-l10n
    - remove the license files installed from the embedded copy of
      KSyntaxHighlighting
    - the switch enables the build of the QML Designer plugin, which is built
      only when using Qt >= 6.2.0 (Closes: #1006555)
  * qtcreator now uses clangd instead of libclang for the Clang code model:
    - add clangd >= 14 as dependency: the unversioned name is used, and the
      current requirement is 14+
    - stop depending on the version of clang-N used by the unversioned clang,
      as there is no more need for the exact Clang version to locale the Clang
      includes
    - add the same clangd version also as build dependency: while it is not
      needed at build time, it makes sure that qtcreator can be built only when
      the runtime clangd requirement is satisfied

    available shared libraries of clang rather than the static LLVM ones.

    - add the cmake build dependency
    - drop all the other patches related to qmake bits that are not needed
      anymore: rpath_nonlinux.diff, remove_libexec.diff,
      fix_documentation_path.diff, and desktop_nonlinux.diff
    - adapt rules:
      - force the cmake buildsystem, as dh prefers qmake when autodetecting
      - pass -DBUILD_QBS=OFF to not build the embedded copy of qbs
      - enable, build, and install the documentation only when qtcreator-doc
        is built
      - remove duplicated installed files to keep qtcreator-data.install simple
      - export QTC_BUILD_PLUGIN_HELLOWORLD=FALSE to not build the HelloWorld
        plugin (replaces the qmake variable IDE_PACKAGE_MODE=1)
    - update install files
    - create compatibility symlinks for the moved paths of the HTML docs
  * Drop all the LICENSE.LGPL symlinks we create, as those license files are
    not installed anymore.
  * Remove extra executable permissions from qmldir files.
  * Update lintian overrides.
  * Disable shlibs on the internal libraries, as it is pointless.
  * Add the libqt5svg5-dev, and libzstd-dev build dependencies for extra
    features.
  * Drop the unapplied patches always_autotect_qt_versions, and
    fix_qt_version_autodetection.diff: they were added many years ago, with
    not many details on what was the actual problem or whether it was reported
    upstream; they have not been applied for a year and we got no reports about
    them, so drop them for good.
  * Export QTC_BUILD_PLUGIN_CLANGFORMAT=FALSE to disable the build of the
    ClangFormat plugin, as it requires clang-format with a patch not accepted
    yet (Closes: #939825) (LP: #1876436); see:

    - Build depend upon llvm-6.0-dev on all archs.
    - Once again pass LLVM_INSTALL_DIR to the config script. In Debian
      llvm-config is suffixed by the LLVM version, so the correct path

  * Switch the kdelibs5-data suggest to kate-data, since the latter is where

  * Use https in the watch file.
  * Move desktop file, and appdata file from qtcreator-data to qtcreator, as
    they must be together with the executable they refer to
    - add proper breaks/replaces
  * Add the zlib1g-dev build dependency: apparently LLVM/Clang 3.9 exposes -lz

  * Use the pre-built gdbmacros for Debian's Qt installation only.
    Qt Creator will no longer errenously try to use the pre-built
    gdbmacros for all Qt installations.

 -- Adam Majer <adamm@zombino.com>  Thu, 30 Jul 2009 09:18:51 -0500

qtcreator (1.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    + Includes git patches to 1.2.x tree until 2009-07-07.

  [ Fathi Boudra ]
  * Bump Standard-Version to 3.8.2. No changes needed.
  * Update debian/rules:
    - Remove translations build. Infrastructure for translations added
      upstream.
    - Improve clean target by removing extra directories.
    - Remove dh_desktop call. Deprecated.
    - Add qt4-demos to Recommends. The combobox in the welcome page relies on
      qt4-docs and qt4-demos being installed.
  * Update debian/qtcreator.install.
  * Fix wrapper target path moved to bin/bin.pro.
  * Fix static and translations target installation.

  [ Adam Majer ]
  * Removed some lintian errors from overrides. They should not be ignored.
  * Remove installation of gdbmacros. This needs to be compiled per
    version of Qt. Qt Creator automates this process and will compile
    and install the debugging helper in the user's local directory.
    The compilation routine is in the Tools -> Options -> Qt 4 -> Version
    window.
  * Install the LGPL_EXCEPTION.TXT in addition to mentioning it in copyright
    as gdbmacros source code that is copied to user's local directory
    requires a license.
