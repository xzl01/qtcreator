            \li You can use different animation techniques for different
                purposes. \QDS supports common motion design techniques,
                such as timeline and keyframe based animation and easing
                curves, as well as screen-to-screen or state-to-state
                application flows and data-driven UI logic animation.

        \li \l {Introduction to Animation Techniques}

            Learn more about which animation techniques are supported by \QDS
            and the use cases they are most suitable for.

        \li \l {Creating Timeline Animations}

            You can use a timeline and keyframe based editor in the
            \l Timeline view to animate the properties of UI
            components. Animating properties enables their values to
            move through intermediate values at specified keyframes
            instead of immediately changing to the target value.
        \li \l{Editing Easing Curves}

            Specify easing curves for nonlinear interpolation between
            keyframes in timeline animations, as well as between original
            and new property values in property animations and between
            transitions.
        \li \l {Production Quality}

            After the wireframing and prototyping phases, you can use previewing
            and profiling tools to fine-tune your UI for production.
        \li \l{Optimizing Designs}

            You can test your UIs on the target devices to make sure you get
            the best performance out of your animations. To solve performance
            problems, you typically need to optimize the graphical assets used
            in the UI, such as images, effects, or 3D scenes.
