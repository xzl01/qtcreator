            \li After your UI wireframe has been approved, you can turn it
                into an interactive prototype to ensure that you and the
                developers share a common vision about the UI appearance
                and functionality. You can create the UI logic to simulate
                complex experiences and add dynamic behavior. You can then
                validate your design on desktop, embedded, and mobile device
                platforms. In the prototyping phase, you can also import
                assets from 2D and 3D content creation tools to bring your
                prototype closer to the final UI.

        \li \l {Creating UI Logic}

            You can turn your wireframe into an interactive prototype by
            adding the logic that enables your components to apply actions
            or react to mock data from backend systems to simulate complex
            experiences.
        \li \l{Simulating Complex Experiences}

            You can connect UIs to different forms of data from various
            sources, such as QML-based data models, JavaScript files, and
            backend services.
            You can also connect your UI to Simulink to load live data from
            a Simulink simulation.

        \li \l {Dynamic Behaviors}

            You can create connections between components to enable them to
            communicate with each other. The connections can be triggered by
            changes in component property values or in UI states.

        \li \l {Validating with Target Hardware}

            You can use the live preview feature to preview a UI file or the
            entire UI on the desktop, as well as on Android and embedded Linux
            devices. The changes you make to the UI are instantly visible
            to you in the preview.

        \li \l {Asset Creation with Other Tools}

            Describes how to export designs containing 2D and 3D assets into
            files that you can import to projects in \QDS, how to import them,
            and how to export them from \QDS back to the metadata format.
