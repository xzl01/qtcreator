    \title Install plugins

    \l{https://marketplace.qt.io/}{Qt Marketplace} has links to \QC plugins that
    you can download and install either for free or for a price set by their
    publisher. Browse the available plugins in the \uicontrol Marketplace tab
    in the \uicontrol Welcome mode.

    You can also install plugins from other sources, such as
    \l{https://github.com/}{GitHub}.

    \note You can install only plugins that your \QC version supports.
