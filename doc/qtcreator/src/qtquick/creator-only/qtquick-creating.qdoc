    \title Creating Qt Quick Projects

    Use the following wizard templates to create new Qt Quick projects:

    \list
        \li \uicontrol {Application (Qt)} > \uicontrol {Qt Quick Application}
        \li \uicontrol {Application (Qt for Python)} >
            \uicontrol {Qt for Python - Qt Quick Application}
        \li \uicontrol {Other Project} > \uicontrol {Qt Quick UI Prototype}
        \li \uicontrol {Library} > \uicontrol {Qt Quick 2 Extension Plugin}
    \endlist

    The \uicontrol {New Project} dialog shows detailed information about each
    project wizard template.

    \note The SDK for a particular target platform might install additional
    templates for that platform. For example, the QNX templates are installed
    as part of the QNX SDK.

    \QC creates the necessary boilerplate files. Some of the files are
    specific to a particular target platform. You can use wizard templates
    also to \l{Creating Files}{add files} to the projects.

    \section1 Qt Quick Applications

    \list 1

        \li Select \uicontrol File > \uicontrol {New Project} >
            \uicontrol {Application (Qt)} > \uicontrol {Qt Quick Application}
            > \uicontrol Choose.

            \image qtcreator-project-qt-quick.webp {New Project dialog}

            \note To use \l qmake as the build system, develop with Qt 5,
            or add translations to the application, select
            \uicontrol {Qt Quick Application (compat)}.

        \li In the \uicontrol {Project Location} dialog, \uicontrol Name field,
            enter a name for the project. Keep in mind that you cannot easily
            change the project name later.

        \li In the \uicontrol {Create in} field, enter the path for the project
            files. Select the \uicontrol {Use as default project location} check
            box to create new projects in this folder by default. You can move
            project folders later without problems.

        \li Select \uicontrol Next (or \uicontrol Continue on \macos) to open
            the \uicontrol {Define Build System} dialog.

            \image qtcreator-project-qt-quick-details.webp {Define Project Details dialog}

            To create a project that you can develop with a visual editor in
            \QDS, select \uicontrol {Create a project that you can open in \QDS}.

        \li In the \uicontrol {Build system} field, select the build system to
            use for building and running the project: \l {Setting Up CMake}
            {CMake} or \l {Setting Up Qbs}{Qbs}.

        \li Select \uicontrol Next to open the
            \uicontrol {Define Project Details} dialog.

        \li Select the Qt version to develop with in the
            \uicontrol {Minimum required Qt version} field.
            The Qt version determines the Qt Quick imports
            that are used in the QML files.

        \li Select the \uicontrol {Use Qt Virtual Keyboard} check box to add
            support for \l{Qt Virtual Keyboard} to the application.

            \note If you have not installed the Qt Virtual Keyboard module when
            you installed Qt, an error message will appear when you try to open
            \e Main.qml for editing. You can use the \l {Installing Qt}
            {Qt Maintenance Tool} to install Qt Virtual Keyboard.

        \li Select \uicontrol Next to open the \uicontrol {Kit Selection}
            dialog.

        \li Select \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{kits} for the platforms that
            you want to build the application for.

            \note Kits are listed if they have been specified in \uicontrol Edit
            > \uicontrol Preferences > \uicontrol Kits (on Windows and Linux)
            or in \uicontrol {\QC} > \uicontrol Preferences >
            \uicontrol Kits (on \macos).
            For more information, see \l {Adding Kits}.

        \li Select \uicontrol Next to open the \uicontrol {Project Management}
            dialog.

        \li Review the project settings, and select \uicontrol Finish
            (on Windows and Linux) or \uicontrol Done (on \macos) to
            create the project.

    \endlist

    \QC creates a QML file, \e Main.qml, that you can modify in the
    \uicontrol Edit mode.

    \include creator-python-project.qdocinc python qml project wizards

    \section1 Qt Quick UI Projects

    Qt Quick UI Prototype projects are useful for testing or prototyping user
    interfaces,
    or for setting up a separate project just for QML editing, for example. You
    cannot use them for application development because they do not have:

    \list
        \li C++ code
        \li Resource files (.qrc)
        \li Code needed for deploying applications to \l{glossary-device}
            {devices}
    \endlist

    For more information about how to turn Qt Quick UI Prototype projects into
    Qt Quick Application projects, see
    \l{Converting UI Projects to Applications}.

    To create a Qt Quick UI Prototype project:

    \list 1

        \li Select \uicontrol File > \uicontrol {New Project} >
            \uicontrol {Other Project} > \uicontrol {Qt Quick UI Prototype}.

        \li Select \uicontrol Choose to open the \uicontrol {Project Location}
            dialog.

        \li In the \uicontrol Name field, enter a name for the application.

        \li In the \uicontrol {Create in} field, enter the path for the project
            files. Select the \uicontrol {Use as default project location} check
            box to create new projects in this folder by default.

        \li Select \uicontrol Next (or \uicontrol Continue on \macos) to open
            the \uicontrol {Define Project Details} dialog.

        \li In the \uicontrol {Minimum required Qt version} field, select the Qt
            version to develop with. The Qt version determines the Qt Quick
            imports that are used in the QML files.

            You can add imports later to combine Qt Quick basic types with
            Qt Quick Controls, Qt Quick Dialogs, and Qt Quick Layouts (available
            since Qt 5.1).

        \li Select the \uicontrol {Use Qt Virtual Keyboard} check box to add
            support for \l{Qt Virtual Keyboard} to the application.

            \note If you have not installed the Qt Virtual Keyboard module when
            you installed Qt, an error message will appear when you try to open
            \e main.qml.

        \li Select \uicontrol Next to open the \uicontrol {Kit Selection}
            dialog.

        \li Select \l{glossary-buildandrun-kit}{kits} for the platforms that
            you want to build the application for.

            \note Kits are listed if they have been specified in \uicontrol Edit
            > \uicontrol Preferences > \uicontrol Kits (on Windows and Linux)
            or in \uicontrol {\QC} > \uicontrol Preferences >
            \uicontrol Kits (on \macos).
            For more information, see \l {Adding Kits}.

        \li Select \uicontrol Next to open the \uicontrol {Project Management}
            dialog.

        \li Review the project settings, and select \uicontrol Finish
            (on Windows and Linux) or \uicontrol Done (on \macos) to
            create the project.

    \endlist

    \QC creates the following files:

    \list

        \li .qmlproject project file defines that all QML, JavaScript, and image
            files in the project folder belong to the project. Therefore, you do
            not need to individually list all the files in the project.

        \li .qml file defines a UI item, such as a component or the
            whole application UI.

        \li ui.qml file defines a form for the application UI. This file is
            created if you selected the \uicontrol {With .ui.qml file} check
            box.

    \endlist

    To use JavaScript and image files in the application, copy them to the
    project folder.
